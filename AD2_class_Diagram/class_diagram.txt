I made a class Diagram showing a Dragon class and a wizard class. 
The Dragon and the Wizard classes interact with each other by attacking and casting spells.

Classes are useful because they help me to define data and methods which 
pertain to each particular class. They help me to use object-oriented programming
and focus on separation of responsibilities. I can have each class be responsible for
its own data and its own methods.
