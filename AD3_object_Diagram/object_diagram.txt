Sven is an instance of the Wizard class. 
Eldrid is an instance of the Dragon class. 
I have given them each attributes.

Objects are instances of classes. THey are useful because they
contain the data and methods of their class, uniquely implemented.
I can use objects to create the workers and the doers. The class 
is like a blueprint for how objects of that class should be created.
The class defines how the object should behave, how it exists, and 
what methods it can take advantage of.
